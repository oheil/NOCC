NOCC Upgrade guide

Before upgrade
==============

  Before upgrading your NOCC installation, you should backup the following files
    </path/to/nocc/>config/conf.php
    </path/to/nocc/>config/login_alias (if used)
    </path/to/nocc/>config/login_allowed (if used)
    </path/to/nocc/prefs/>*.* (if used, "$conf->prefs_dir" config setting)

Upgrade steps
=============

  1) Remove your nocc installation (you may leave your nocc prefs folder
     untouched).

  2) Untar/unzip NOCC into the directory you want.

  3) Restore the files you have previously backuped. Then compare your conf.php
     file and conf.php.dist file to check for new configuration settings.

  4) (Optional step)
     if you run with suEXEC, you'll need to run './addcgipath path' to add
     the parser line at the beginning of PHP files.

  5) Remove ./addcgipath.sh. For security reasons, it might be run by
     external users although "sh" files are never interpreted by Web
     servers with default configuration.

  6) Use and enjoy your new NOCC installation.
