The full documentation can be found in README, this is meant to be a quick
installation guide for people who don't want to bother the whole documentation.

Requirements
============

Mandatory Items
---------------

   * PHP 5.0.0 or later with IMAP (--with-imap), iconv (enabled by default) and
     mbstring (--enable-mbstring) support. -- SEE NEXT SECTION 
  
   * A Web server supported by PHP (i.e. Apache for most people)
  
   * An IMAP or POP3 server to connect to.

Optional Items
--------------

   * An SSL Web server to allow encrypted connections.
     (Apache+mod_ssl+OpenSSL is popular)
   * Horde/Imap_Client Library
     https://dev.horde.org/imap_client/
     This is an alternative library to connect to an IMAP/POP3 mail
     server.

Notes on PHP
------------

   * PHP needs to be compiled with IMAP, iconv and mbstring support
     (--with-imap and --enable-mbstring at the configure stage).
   * register_globals directive must be set to 'Off'.
   * You'll find information on IMAP support for PHP at
     'http://www.php.net/manual/ref.imap.php'.

Installing NOCC
===============

If you upgrade from a previous installation, you should read UPGRADE file.

Installation of NOCC
--------------------
       
       1) Download nocc-x.y.tar.gz (where x and y are version numbers)
          (or nocc-x.y.zip for Windows' users).
          http://nocc.sourceforge.net/

       2) untar/unzip nocc into the directory you want.
          Default directory is nocc.
   
       3) Change into the 'nocc/webmail/config' directory, make changes to the 
          config file (conf.php.dist) and save the new one to conf.php
          (remove .dist in the file name)

           'conf.php.dist' contains a large number of default values
           that you'll need to configure for your system, such as
           the default IMAP/POP3 server, whether or not users can pick a
           different server, etc...
           The file is fairly well documented, so you should be able to pick
           out what you need to change fairly easily.
           Be sure to check the '$prefs_dir' is writable by the user the
           webserver is running as.

       4) (Optional step)
          if you run with suEXEC, you'll need to run './addcgipath path' to add
          the parser line at the beginning of PHP files.

       5) Remove ./addcgipath.sh. For security reasons, it might be run by
          external users although "sh" files are never interpreted by Web
          servers with default configuration.
